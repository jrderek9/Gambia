# GTA Data Warehouse Demo Script

## Introduction (2 minutes)

"Good morning, distinguished members of the Gambian Tax Authority. Today, I'm excited to demonstrate how a modern data warehouse can transform your tax administration operations.

As we all know, GTA currently manages over 500,000 taxpayers across multiple disconnected systems, with 60% of staff time spent on manual data manipulation. This demo will show how we can:
- Increase revenue collection by 15-20% through better fraud detection
- Reduce manual processing time by 60%
- Enable real-time insights within 1 hour
- Implement ML-driven fraud detection with 85%+ accuracy

Let me show you how Sarah, one of your tax analysts, would use this system in her daily work."
